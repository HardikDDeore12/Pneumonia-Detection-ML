# ü´Å Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based solution to detect **pneumonia** from **chest X-ray images** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project helps automate the diagnosis process and assist radiologists in identifying pneumonia cases more efficiently.

## üìå Overview

Pneumonia is a life-threatening lung infection. Early and accurate detection is crucial for timely treatment. This project uses a CNN model trained on publicly available chest X-ray images to classify images as:

- üü¢ **Normal**
- üî¥ **Pneumonia**
